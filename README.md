ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kendall Smith, Welcome to my public GitHub project portfolio!

I am a geospatial data scientist and software engineer who is completing his masters in computer science from Northeastern University in December of 2021. My passion to leverage state of the art machine learning technology to solve some of the most pressing matters of our time, like climate change, is what has led me to earn my Masters of Science in Computer Science with a specialization in artificial intelligence and urban analytics.

On this site, you will find a collection of the projects I have completed as part of my masters curriculum, as well as some projects I worked on because of my personal interest in algorithmic trading. Here is a breif summary of the repositories I would like to highlight from my portoflio

 - CryptoSonar -> DeFi web application project completed in collaboration with Joffrey Inocencio, used to track the activity of traders by wallet address in the decentralized Binance Smart Chain blockchain network.
 - G-MAP/dashboard_webap (private) -> web application to track COVID spatial and temporal patterns in the COVID-19 pandemic, built using the ArcGIS JavaScript API.
 - automatic_solar_pv_detection -> deep learning project showcasing use of computer vision algorithms to identify the presence of solar PV panels from high resolution orthoimagery.
 - machine-learning/virulent-disease-classifier-release -> notebooks and scripts of deployed tool to predict the virulency of uploaded DNA/RNA sequences.
 - machine-learning/drivendata.org_projects/caribbean_open_ai -> deep learning project using computer vision algorithms to classify the natural disaster risk of buildings in developing and underdeveloped Caribbean nations.

Below you can find the links to some of the deployed products from the projects listed highlighted above:
