ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kendall Smith, Welcome to my public GitHub project portfolio!

I am a geospatial data scientist and software engineer who is completing his masters in computer science from Northeastern University in December of 2021. My passion to leverage state of the art machine learning technology to solve some of the most pressing matters of our time, like climate change, is what has led me to earn my Masters of Science in Computer Science with a specialization in artificial intelligence and urban analytics.

My other public repository (https://github.com/KennSmithDS/CryptoSonar) is a DeFi web application project I completed in collaboration with Joffrey Inocencio.
